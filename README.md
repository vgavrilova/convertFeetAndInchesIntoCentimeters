# convertFeetAndInchesIntoCentimeters

Hello everyone!

I continue doing my pet projects in Java. This time I present you a simple program that converts feet and inches into centimeters. 

For creating this converter I've used overloading methods. Moreover, I've decided to use a ternary operator for saving some space
(And honestly, I've just wanted to try this out eventually). For the detailed description see the commented code.


Please tell me if you have any questions or suggestions.

Have fun!
